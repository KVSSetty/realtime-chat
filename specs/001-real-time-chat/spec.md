# Feature Specification: Real-time Chat System

**Feature Branch**: `001-real-time-chat`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Real-time chat system with message history and user presence"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Extracted: real-time messaging, message persistence, presence tracking
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: users, chat participants
   ’ Actions: send messages, view history, see online status
   ’ Data: messages, user presence state
   ’ Constraints: real-time delivery
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication method not specified]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: message retention policy not specified]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum concurrent users not specified]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary flow: join chat, send/receive messages, see history
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Real-time messaging, persistence, presence tracking
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ User, Message, ChatRoom, PresenceStatus
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN "Spec has uncertainties - needs clarification on auth and scaling"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarifications)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users want to participate in real-time conversations with immediate message delivery, ability to see conversation history, and awareness of who else is currently online and available to chat.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user opens the chat application, **When** they send a message, **Then** all other online users receive the message instantly
2. **Given** a user joins a chat room, **When** they scroll up, **Then** they can view previous messages in chronological order
3. **Given** multiple users are online, **When** a user views the chat interface, **Then** they can see which users are currently active/online
4. **Given** a user goes offline, **When** other users view the participant list, **Then** the offline user's status is updated accordingly
5. **Given** a user returns to the chat after being offline, **When** they open the application, **Then** they can see messages that were sent while they were away

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user loses internet connection mid-conversation?
- How does the system handle message delivery when the recipient is offline?
- What occurs when two users send messages simultaneously?
- How are very long messages or rapid message sequences handled?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST deliver messages to all online participants in real-time (within 2 seconds)
- **FR-002**: System MUST persist all messages for historical viewing
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to view message history when joining or returning to a chat
- **FR-004**: System MUST track and display user presence status (online/offline)
- **FR-005**: System MUST update presence status when users join, leave, or disconnect
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to send text messages to the chat room
- **FR-007**: System MUST display messages in chronological order with timestamps
- **FR-008**: System MUST identify message authors clearly
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle user authentication [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - anonymous, username/password, OAuth?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST define message retention policy [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how long are messages stored?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST support concurrent users [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum number of simultaneous users?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents a chat participant with unique identity and presence status
- **Message**: Contains text content, author, timestamp, and delivery status
- **ChatRoom**: Represents the conversation space where messages are exchanged
- **PresenceStatus**: Tracks user's current availability state (online, offline, away)
