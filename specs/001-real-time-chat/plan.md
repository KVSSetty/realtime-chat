# Implementation Plan: Real-time Chat System

**Branch**: `001-real-time-chat` | **Date**: 2025-09-17 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-real-time-chat/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path ✓
   → Feature spec loaded successfully
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION) ✓
   → Detected real-time messaging, persistence, presence tracking requirements
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type (web application)
3. Fill the Constitution Check section ✓
   → Constitution template found but not yet configured
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section ✓
   → No specific constitutional violations identified
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md ✓
   → Researched WebSocket libraries, PostgreSQL integration, Redis setup
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md ✓
   → Generated data models, API contracts, quickstart scenarios
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section ✓
   → No new violations after design
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach ✓
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command ✓
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Primary requirement: Real-time chat system with instant message delivery, persistent message history, and user presence tracking. Technical approach: WebSocket-based real-time communication, PostgreSQL for message persistence, Redis for presence state management.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: JavaScript/TypeScript with Node.js 18+
**Primary Dependencies**: Socket.io (WebSocket), Express.js (REST API), PostgreSQL client, Redis client
**Storage**: PostgreSQL for message history, Redis for presence/session state
**Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Supertest for API testing, Socket.io-client for WebSocket testing
**Target Platform**: Web application (browser + Node.js server)
**Project Type**: web - determines source structure (backend + frontend)
**Performance Goals**: <200ms message delivery, support 1000+ concurrent users, 99.9% uptime
**Constraints**: Real-time delivery requirement, message persistence, scalable presence tracking
**Scale/Scope**: Support chat rooms with 50+ participants, 10k+ messages/day, multi-room capability

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Constitution Template**: No specific constitution found - using default development practices
- ✅ Library-first approach: WebSocket service as standalone module
- ✅ Clear interfaces: REST API + WebSocket contracts
- ✅ Test-first development: Contract tests before implementation
- ✅ Simple architecture: Direct database access, minimal abstractions

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - real-time chat requires both backend WebSocket server and frontend client

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Research Tasks Completed
1. **WebSocket Library Research**:
   - **Decision**: Socket.io for WebSocket implementation
   - **Rationale**: Built-in fallbacks, room support, broad browser compatibility
   - **Alternatives considered**: Native WebSocket API (lacks room management), ws library (more manual setup)

2. **Database Strategy Research**:
   - **Decision**: PostgreSQL with message partitioning by date
   - **Rationale**: ACID compliance for message integrity, excellent concurrent performance
   - **Alternatives considered**: MongoDB (less consistent), SQLite (single-user limitation)

3. **Presence Management Research**:
   - **Decision**: Redis with expiring keys for presence state
   - **Rationale**: Fast in-memory operations, automatic cleanup via TTL
   - **Alternatives considered**: Database polling (too slow), in-memory only (loses state on restart)

4. **Real-time Architecture Research**:
   - **Decision**: Socket.io rooms for chat organization
   - **Rationale**: Built-in broadcast capabilities, automatic connection management
   - **Alternatives considered**: Manual WebSocket routing (more complex), pub/sub only (lacks direct connection management)

**Output**: All technical decisions resolved for implementation

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Data Model Design
**Entities identified**:
- **User**: identity, presence state, connection metadata
- **Message**: content, author, timestamp, chat room
- **ChatRoom**: room identifier, participant list, settings
- **PresenceStatus**: online/offline state, last seen timestamp

### API Contracts Generated
**REST Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/rooms` - List available chat rooms
- `POST /api/rooms` - Create new chat room
- `GET /api/rooms/:id/messages` - Get message history
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User authentication

**WebSocket Events**:
- `join_room` - Join a chat room
- `leave_room` - Leave a chat room
- `send_message` - Send message to room
- `message_received` - Broadcast new message
- `user_joined` - User presence notification
- `user_left` - User departure notification

### Contract Tests Framework
Test files generated for each endpoint and WebSocket event to validate request/response schemas before implementation.

### Integration Test Scenarios
Key user flows extracted from feature specification:
1. User joins room and sees message history
2. User sends message, others receive instantly
3. User presence updates when joining/leaving
4. Message persistence verification

**Output**: Comprehensive design documentation and test framework ready for implementation

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each WebSocket event → contract test task [P]
- Each REST endpoint → API test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Database setup and migration tasks
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Database models → Services → API → WebSocket → Frontend
- Infrastructure first: Database, Redis setup
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations requiring justification*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
